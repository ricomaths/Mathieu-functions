# Mathieu-functions

This code contains functions to compute the modified Mathieu functions of the second kind (for q < 0) defined in 28.24.6-28.24.13 DLMF.

It also contains the separation of variables solution of the steady 2D convection-diffusion problem in polar coordinates when the flow is potential. 
Of course, the solution is provided in terms of Mathieu functions.

I added a simple code to write the ce and se functions as complex Fourier series
